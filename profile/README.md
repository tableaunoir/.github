Tableaunoir is an **open-source online collaborative blackboard** solution with **fridge magnets** available in **many languages**. The word ["Tableau noir" means blackboard in French](https://www.deepl.com/translator#fr/en/Tableau%20noir). Tableaunoir differs from plenty of other collaborative boards on the Internet in these aspects. First Tableaunoir has a **minimalistic graphical user interface**. In particular the user may just have a **completely black screen** on which to write. Second, Tableaunoir **respects and protect people's privacy and personal data**: the system does not store any information on the server side.

Finally, with Tableaunoir the user can create intuitive explanations, **interactive animations, presentations and videos**. To do that, it relies on **fridge/blackboard magnets** like we had in childhood. These magnets can be images that the user inserts, or some portions of the blackboard that are converted into magnets. Magnets can then be moved to explain a concept.
